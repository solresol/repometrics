# AGENTS instructions

All changes in this repository should ensure that programs rely only on standard Python libraries unless otherwise specified. When adding data visualizations, prefer simple solutions that do not require external dependencies. When running tests or scripts, note if commands fail due to missing packages or network restrictions.

The visualization script `generate_trends.py` may use pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
